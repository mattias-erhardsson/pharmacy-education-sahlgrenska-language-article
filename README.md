This repository accompanies an article submission to the journal Pharmacy Education. 
The files within contain the pseudonymized student data, script, and outputs which form the basis for the results of this article submission.
Reproducibility of analyses is enhanced through the renv package and setting an initial seed in the script.
The 'raison d'Ãªtre' of this repository is transparent reporting in the spirit of open science.

To run the analyses yourself, first open the R project file with R studio. Then, open the R script and run through it.

R version 4.3.1 was used to run the script.
